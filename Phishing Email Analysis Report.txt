->Phishing Analysis Steps
1. Sender Email Spoofing
Sender: support@apple-security-team.com

This domain does not belong to Apple. Official Apple emails come from @apple.com.
Spoofed / fake sender email detected

2. Email Header Discrepancies
Using an online header analyzer (e.g., MXToolbox), we would likely find:

Return-Path mismatch

SPF or DKIM authentication failures

Origin server not associated with Apple
Header anomalies confirm phishing attempt

3. Suspicious Links / Attachments
Displayed URL: https://appleid-verify-login.com

Real URL (hover): http://phishingsite.ru/login.php

Attachment: Apple_ID_Verification.htm (potential phishing page)
Links and attachments are malicious

4. Urgent or Threatening Language
Phrases include:

“Unusual sign-in activity”

“Temporarily locked”

“Permanent suspension in 24 hours”
Uses urgency and fear to manipulate user

5. Mismatched URLs
Visible URL implies legitimacy

Hovered link shows a completely different, malicious domain

URL mismatch — common phishing tactic

6. Spelling / Grammar Errors
No blatant spelling errors

Tone is generic and aggressive, which is not typical for professional companies
Suspicious tone even if spelling is correct
